# personalwebsite
This repo is for my personal website.
This will service both as a foundational project to get me familiar with creating my own websites, and as a personal resume.
It will contain information about myself, my resume, and projects I have worked on.
As such, I will keep updating it as I grow my knowledge base and experience.
